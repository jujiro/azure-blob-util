## Introduction
Microsoft provides Azure Storage Explorer to perform various operations.  It is a great tool, however, it is still an interactive tool.  AzCopy is a yet another utility from Microsoft.  AzCopy is a batch utility and runs very fast.  Azure-blob-util is a hybrid of Azure Storage Explorer and AzCopy.

Using this command line tool, you can list, delete, download, or copy blobs.  The copy function copies blobs from one storage location to the other.
